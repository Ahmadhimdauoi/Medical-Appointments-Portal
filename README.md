 Medical Appointments Portal – Presentation Summary

- **Objective**: Build a frontend-only, realistic, responsive portal for booking medical appointments using local JSON as the data source.

- **Core Features** 
- **Doctor search & filter**: Free-text search by name/specialty and filter by specialty. 
- **Doctor profiles**: Photo, specialty, location, bio, and available slots per date. 
- **Booking flow**: Select date/time, enter patient info, validation, and confirmation with an ID. 
- **Internationalization**: English/Arabic UI strings with automatic RTL layout for Arabic. 
- **Theming**: Light/Dark theme toggle with persistence. 
- **Routing**: Client-side navigation (Home → Doctor Details → Confirmation).

- **Data Model** 
- Uses `src/data/doctors.json` (array of doctors) as the single source of truth. 
- Types aligned to JSON: `id (number)`, `name`, `specialty`, `photo`, `location`, `bio`, `availableSlots[{ date, times[] }]`.

- **Tech Stack & Architecture** 
- **React + TypeScript + Vite** for fast DX and type safety. 
- **React Router** for navigation. 
- **Context API**: 
- `ThemeContext` for theme toggle and CSS variables. 
- `LanguageContext` for current language and translations. 
- **LocalStorage** for persisting theme, language, and the last booked appointment. 
- **CSS**: Responsive, accessible components with theme-based CSS variables.

- **Key Components** 
- `Header`: Theme and language toggles. 
- `DoctorSearch`: Search + specialty filter; grid of `DoctorCard`. 
- `DoctorCard`: Compact doctor preview card. 
- `DoctorDetails`: Full profile + booking form with date/time slot selection. 
- `AppointmentConfirmation`: Success page showing booking details.

- **Accessibility & UX** 
- Semantic HTML, focus states, clear labels, form validation messages. 
- RTL support for Arabic, smooth theme transitions, mobile-first responsive layout.

- **Performance/Quality** 
- Vite pre-bundling and module dedupe to prevent multiple React copies. 
- Type-only imports and strict TS config for clean builds. 
- No runtime errors or type/lint issues in build.

- **Demo Flow** 
1. Toggle theme and language in the header. 
2. Search or filter specialists on Home. 
3. Open a doctor profile, choose a date, choose a time, submit the form. 
4. Land on confirmation page with a unique confirmation ID.

- **Challenges & Resolutions** 
- “Invalid hook call” from router: fixed by deduping React modules in `vite.config.ts`. 
- Data shape changes: refactored types and components to match the provided JSON (without modifying it).

- **Future Enhancements** 
- Saved appointments list/history page. 
- Pagination and advanced filters (location, availability). 
- Form enhancements (SMS/email confirmation mock, input masks). 
- Unit tests and e2e tests (Vitest/Playwright).

- **Outcome** 
- A polished, responsive, bilingual, theme-aware appointment portal built entirely on the provided JSON dataset, ready for demos and further expansion.
